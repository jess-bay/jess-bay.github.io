      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity would be the brain's ability to form new neural
        connections the more it learns and adapts. This adaptability allows the
        brain to adjust its structure and function in response to experience and
        learning. It involves the strengthening or weakening of existing neural
        pathways and the creation of new ones.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How does engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity benefit you?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Understanding neuroplasticity can empower individuals to take an active
        role in shaping their brain's development and functioning, leading to
        improved cognitive abilities, emotional well-being and overall quality
        of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incorporating a combination of learning, cognitive challenges, physical
        challenges, social interactions and exposure to new experiences, will
        allow for a holistic approach to neuroplasticity (the practices). The
        key is to maintain a lifestyle that continually challenges your brain,
        to promote its growth. The very idea of neuroplasticity is the growth of
        one's brain and the adaptability in changing. By knowing when and how to
        practice neuroplasticity, it can greatly benefit anyone's life in terms
        of having increased neurotransmitters, perhaps increased social
        connection as well as general increased cognitive capabilities. As I
        recently learned; those who are aware of the idea of neuroplasticity and
        its benefits, show greater results based on some research done by Lisa
        Blackwell and Kali Trzesniewski.
      </p>
      <p>
        I view our collective journey through Dev Academy as the perfect example
        of practicing neuroplasticity. Not only are we taught to come up with
        our own solutions, but there is always constructive feedback, ways to
        continuously improve and we're constantly learning something new (at
        least I am)!
      </p>
      <h3>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        The ability of our brain to create new pathways is an amazing concept.
        This idea also includes strengthening existing pathways. But how do we
        do it? Here are the main 3 points that I have taken from this learning
        experience and found the most useful for easy application into everyday
        life:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Practice! Creating and strengthening neural pathways has a similar
          concept to building muscle. You perform the exercise over and over in
          order to see the results. With this practice, comes the idea of
          adapting to new solutions when the first ones fail.
        </li>
        <li>
          Understand what you're doing. Put the information into context that
          you can understand and allow your brain to understand what it's doing.
          Having knowledge of neuroplasticity and its training can greatly
          benefit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nurture your brain and your body. Practice not only continuous
          learning, but a healthy lifestyle. Fitness, nutrition and social
          interaction can be taken into account for overall health.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Another important tip to note is how much putting information into a
        context is helpful. This simply means, find a way to understand the
        material you're learning. Also, understand what your brain is doing when
        you're practicing, this particularly helps.
      </p>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        A growth mindset is a psychological concept developed by Carol Dweck,
        wherein it refers to the belief that one's abilities and intelligence
        can be developed through dedication, hard work and problem-solving.
      </p>
      <h3>What is it and why is it relevant to us?</h3>
      <p>
        Having a growth mindset can promote a more positive approach to learning
        and development. In her TED Talk, Carol talks about the "not yet"
        mindset, where just because you didn't get your desired outcome, doesn't
        mean you never will. It just means you didn't get it "yet". With this
        mindset, you can see how it would become easier to problem-solve and
        adapt to create the desired outcome, rather than just being told "you
        didn't get it". Growth mindset is knowing your mind will adapt and learn
        from criticism or rejection. It's a mindset of wanting continuous
        improvement through dedication and perseverance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think about it, a growth mindset and neuroplasticity are closely
        linked. Both of these concepts share similar ideas; change and
        adaptability, positive outlook on challenges, belief in potential
        improvement and continuous learning. The difference between the two
        concepts, though, is that a growth mindset emphasises beliefs and
        attitudes. Arguably, it's the driving force to making change and
        learning new things. Without a good attitude to learning, you wouldn't
        be as open to change and therefore will not fully embrace it.
      </p>
      <h3>How can we link this to our learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I like to think that I practice a growth mindset by learning from my
        mistakes and developing plans to overcome them. It's also important to
        me to look to different sources of knowledge, rather than just the same
        one so that I'm exposed to new ideas or strategies and so that I'm able
        to implement them into my learning and my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned before, the journey we on at Dev Academy is a great place
        to practice our growth mindset. We are going to come up with a lot of
        challenges (and we already have), so it can be good to adopt the "not
        yet" growth mindset and have patience and perserverance in our journeys.
