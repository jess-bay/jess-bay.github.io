      <h2>A time that I was blocked on a simple problem...</h2>
      <p>
        The problem I had was in manipulating objects. I was trying to add a
        child named Ben into Terah's object, but for some reason the test was
        not passing, even though the same code layout worked for adding the
        other 2 children. I first Googled to make sure that I was correct with
        the other 2 pieces of code. When I couldn't find my answer, I asked
        ChatGPT. It also told me that the code should work. After about 2 hours
        trying to solve it myself, I reached out to my Facilitator, Lucy. She
        helped me troubleshoot from the bottom up, to make sure everything was
        in order. Eventually, we realised that the solution was to use dot
        notation in order to create this first child.
      </p>
      <div class="problem-code">
        <p>What I had for Ben, and the other 2 children, looked like this:</p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >terah.children = { ...terah.children, ben: { name: 'Ben', },
            }</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>But I needed this:</p>
        <p><strong>terah.children.ben = ben = { name: 'Ben', }</strong></p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Throughout the process, I felt confused, frustrated and overwhelmed all
        in one. Because it seemed such a simple question, so in my head I
        thought I should've had a simple code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learnt the valuable lesson of asking for help on time. If I had tried
        to solve it myself, I could've spent hours and hours on it, but my
        Facilitator knew which route to take in order to get the task done.
      </p>
      <h2>How did I elegantly solve a problem?</h2>
      <p>
        Creating the win function for my athletes array and adding the win
        property to each athlete was the problem I faced. I had what I thought
        was the perfect outline of the code, I filled it in to the best of my
        ability, ran the test andâ€¦ fail. I Googled, I searched through
        previously asked questions on the Discord chats, then I tried different
        layouts. I took words out, added more in, and eventually got there in
        the end through trial and error.
      </p>
      <p>
        I felt a lot more capable solving this problem than I did with the first
        one I mentioned above, because I'd seen the way to go about trial and
        error in some cases whether after speaking with the Facilitator or on
        videos. Through this one, I learnt patience above all else. Patience in
        myself to solve the problem.
      </p>
      <h2>How confident do I feel using the following:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode</strong>: Semi-confident. The reason being is that
          I'm able to break up the question or problem into steps, however I
          found it difficult to put it into my own words seeing a few pointers
          in the questions already done for me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trying something</strong>: Semi-confident. It's never a bad
          idea to try something, but sometimes trying something can take you
          down the wrong rabbit hole.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>: Confident. I prefer to sometimes
          read things aloud and repeat them to myself
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reading Error Messages</strong>: Semi confident. Sometimes,
          I'm able to tell what they mean and other times, I'm not able to. For
          the simple reason that sometimes I can't break down the error message
          the same way I would break down a question/task
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Console.logging</strong>: Semi-confident. I've used it a few
          times when directed, but still getting the hang of it
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Googling</strong>: Confident - google has honestly become my
          bestie
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking Peers For Help</strong>: Semi-confident. It takes a
          while to get over the slight feeling of embarrassment that I feel
          because even though many don't ask questions, doesn't mean they're way
          ahead.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking Coaches For Help</strong>: Confident. It usually would
          be my last resort asking the coaches though because I like to know
          I've tried as many alleys as I can to solve the problem. As I know
          when I ask a coach, the problem will definitely be solved.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving My Process With Reflection</strong>: Semi-confident.
          I'm definitely able to reflect on my processes, but sometimes changing
          them can be the difficult task.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>I was reluctant to ask for help...</h2>
      <p>
        Basically any time I had a problem, that little voice in my head would
        say, "Why are you the only one having this problem?" so I'd look
        elsewhere like Google until I could solve the problem. When I was mostly
        reluctant to ask for help was with the simple problem I described above.
        I like to find the answers myself because the more difficult it is, the
        more likely I am to remember. But I learnt that sometimes it can take a
        lot of pressure off to just ask for help, put the answer in, then do my
        own research after the fact to better understand it.
