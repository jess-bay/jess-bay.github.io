      <h2>
        What are 3 things that I learnt about myself due to the core learning?
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>How to be more patient with myself while learning</li>
        <li>What works for me and what doesn't in terms of learning</li>
        <li>How to look after myself more in times of stress or frustration</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Well I personally feel that the role they play strongly depends on the
        person. My values are reflected in my learning quite a lot because I
        value hardwork and ownership. I think empathy is super important when
        working in a team environment as it helps you to understand those around
        you. Self-awareness is really important in terms of holding myself
        accountable, knowing when I need a break and what learning approaches
        work for me.
      </p>
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        The level of detail that we go into. When it's mentioned in the
        curriculum, you don't think it woul dbe something that would take up a
        fair amount of time or make such a difference to learning, but it does.
        You have to think about it a lot and really reflect on yourself and the
        way you work.
      </p>
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Probably learning self-awareness above all. It can be tricky to work out
        what works and what doesn't, coming up with a learning plan, reflecting
        on your processes. I found the learning plan the trickiest part because
        I've never had a learning plan before, so it was an interesting concept
        to think of.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so muych time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Technical skills can be taught on the job and it's a fairly easy thing
        to teach too - each workplace might have different platforms that they
        work on, different approaches, etc. But interpersonal skills can't
        always be taught in a workplace, which is why it's important to know how
        to work with others, how to hold yourself accountable and how to problem
        solve on your own.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>
        I don't think it's been a waste of time because it frankly doesn't take
        up much time. A lot of the concepts include how to practice mindfulness
        and self-awareness which are just good skills to have no matter who you
        are or where you work. Regardless of whether it's actually practiced
        every day, or once a week. It also gives a nice break from the constant
        learning of programming and lets you to just think of ways to improve
        mentally, emotionally and physically.
