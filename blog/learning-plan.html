      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
      <p>
        A long-term goal of mine would ultimately to be successful. My
        definition of success will definitely change over the years depending on
        what I can achieve, but for now it means to try my best, find a career
        that I enjoy and have opportunity for work-life balance.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h3>
      <p>
        A strength would be determination. I don’t like to leave things
        unfinished. A weakness would be that sometimes I tend to skim read
        rather than take in important facts.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think learning something new like this at Dev Academy, as well as
        having to hold myself accountable and keep trying over and over again
        will definitely help with my patience and I think it’s a great quality
        to develop as studies continue.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives
        </li>
        <li>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
          you
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I like to keep a diary and each day, I list my tasks for the day so I
        can cross them off as I go and I’m not left wondering if I’ve forgotten
        something. When it comes to preventing a build-up, I think my route for
        this would be to ensure that if there’s more than 2 tasks left over from
        the day before, I would either need to put in longer hours or simply ask
        for help before things get too bad or hectic.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h3>
      <p>
        My first point of call is Google, then my next point of call is any
        Facilitator. I know it’s recommended to spend about 20 minutes on a
        problem but I tend to have many breakthroughs after 45 minutes or so,
        and I like the feeling of having figured it out myself as I feel it
        cements in my brain more. However, I do enjoy talking and messaging with
        the Facilitators so it’s not a difficult thing to do.
      </p>

      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing more than what they already provide. They provide timely
        answers, great resources and a lot of patience. from what I have seen
        and also experienced first-hand.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I spend time with friends and family on weekends where possible, but
        other than that, I usually plan my appointments around work or study.
