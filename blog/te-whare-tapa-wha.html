        This blog entry holds key concepts and information on focusing on one's
        holistic health. The ideas behind Te Whare Tapa Wha is to look after
        oneself not only physically, but to look after ourselves emotionally,
        mentally, spiritually, to look after our relationships and what makes us
        feel "in place".
      </p>
      <p>
        These 5 points can be seen as the foundation (Whenua - our connection to
        the land) and our 4 walls (physical, mental/emotional, family, spiritual
        wellbeing).

            I spend time with my family and friends throughout the week during
            the evenings or on weekends. At least once a week is usually the
            frequency, but sometimes it can be more.

            Exercise tends to help me work out (pun not intended) any unwanted
            emotions as well as having an endorphine rush. I also like to
            recharge my emotional and mental battery by either hanging out with
            friends and family or simply watching a movie.

            Think about what I am grateful for, each day. This usually ends up
            being in the evening when I feel the frustrations from the day, so I
            take a step back to think about happy things.
