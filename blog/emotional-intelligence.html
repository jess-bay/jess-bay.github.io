      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        We've all seen the abbreviation "EQ", but what does it actually
        <em>mean</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (aka emotional quotient, or EQ) is the ability to
        manage both your emotions and understand the emotions of those around
        you. It's your ability to perceive, interpret, demonstrate, control and
        evaluate your emotions and communicate with others in a constructive
        manner. It is about developing your capacity to sense how you are coming
        across, to look at your own strengths and weaknesses and assess the
        emotions you're currently feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not mean denying your emotions just because you are 'noticing'
        rather than 'feeling', but it rather means knowing which strengths to
        turn to, how to manage your weaknesses and how to communicate to others.
        It's very centered around self-awareness, self-management and also
        social awareness.
      </p>
      <h3>How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        Emotional Quotient (EQ) is the ability to recognise, understand and
        manage your own emotions as well as the emotions of others. It's also
        the ability to use this to guide one's thinking and control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is the measure of academic capability. It's
        the "traditional" way of measuring one's book-smarts.
      </p>
      <p>
        EQ is the measure of emotional intelligence, whereas IQ is the measure
        of traditional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is being smart with
        emotions and feelings, while traditional intelligence is being smart
        with numerical and verbal data. They're correlated and, in many ways,
        they work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key parts of EQ is the naming and understanding, the self-awareness and
        social awareness. But IQ is needed in order to understand the linguistic
        part of these discoveries.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        Well, EQ can be important in one's personal life if you think of
        understanding oneself as something worthwhile. By this, I mean that it
        can be incredibly beneficial to understand the way you are feeling, the
        way you react when you feel this way, and what it is that helps you to
        manage this. You can also use this way of thinking when it comes to
        friends or family members, it can help you to be more empathetic and
        have a better understanding of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to EQ in the workplace, it's become a more sought-after
        quality for employees to possess. This is because it has been shown in
        various studies that people with a higher EQ have more chance of staying
        within the company. Anyone can learn a task or how to work on a program,
        but not everyone can learn empathy and how to approach different
        emotionally-driven situations. Employers want to see how you control
        yourself and your emotions.
